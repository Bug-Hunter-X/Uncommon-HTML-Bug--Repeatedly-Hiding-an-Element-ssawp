# Uncommon HTML Bug: Repeatedly Hiding an Element

This repository showcases a subtle bug in HTML related to repeatedly hiding an HTML element using JavaScript. The bug is not immediately obvious and only appears under specific conditions.  The solution demonstrates a robust way to handle the hiding of an element, preventing potential issues.

## Bug Description

The original code hides an HTML element using JavaScript. However, it fails to account for scenarios where the element is already hidden. Repeatedly calling the hiding function without checking the element's visibility may lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts in some JavaScript frameworks or complex applications.  The bug isn't always apparent but might contribute to issues in larger projects.

## Solution

The solution provided checks whether the element is already hidden before attempting to hide it again. This ensures a consistent and reliable approach, preventing any potential errors caused by redundant hiding attempts.
